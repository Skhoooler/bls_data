# Overview

This goal of this small rust program is to read data from a file, then gather information from that data. In this program, I analyzed data about the top 70 apps in the Google Play Store and found a few statistics.

I started this project to get introduced to Rust, and learn a little more about how it works. I learned about what a CSV file was, and how to read data from it, and learned more about Rust itself.

# Development Environment

This program was written in Rust using VSCode. I used the CSV crate to deserialize the data in the file.

# Future Work

* Add more points of data to analyze
* Get data from online APIs
* Use different CSV files
